## Instructions for Creating the Excel Assessment Framework

1. **Define the Purpose**  
   Clearly articulate the purpose of the assessment framework. What skills or competencies will it measure?

2. **Identify Key Areas**  
   List the key areas of focus for the assessment. For example, you might want to evaluate skills in collaboration, coding best practices, etc.

3. **Develop Criteria**  
   For each key area, develop specific criteria or indicators that will be used to assess proficiency. These should be measurable and clear.

4. **Create Rating Scale**  
   Design a rating scale for assessment (e.g., 1-5, where 1 is novice and 5 is expert).

5. **Build the Excel Template**  
   Open Excel and create a new spreadsheet.  
   - **Sheet 1:** Title it "Assessment Framework" and include the following columns:  
     - Key Area  
     - Criteria  
     - Rating Scale  
     - Comments  
   - **Sheet 2:** Title it "Summary" to compile results from assessments.

6. **Test the Framework**  
   Run a pilot test of the framework with a small group to gather feedback and make adjustments as needed.

7. **Finalize and Distribute**  
   Finalize the framework and share it with your team for use in assessments.
